# Tic-Tac-Toe
Build a tic-tac-toe game on the command line where two human players can play against each other and the board is displayed in between turns.

# Instructions

 1. The game is played on a grid that's 3 squares by 3 squares.

 2. You are X, your friend is O. Players take turns putting their marks in empty squares.
          
 3. The first player to get 3 of his or her marks in a row (up, down, across or diagonally) is the winner.
          
 4. When all 9 squares are full, the game is over. If no player has 3 marks in a row, the game ends in a tie.
